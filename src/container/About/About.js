          My first venture into the realm of web development happened to coincide
          with the day I published my thesis <span className="about-text highlight ">(Architectural Exploration of CNNs on SoC)</span>. I have thought of
          deploying my thesis project, which is an application of traffic sign recognition, on a webpage that would be <span className="about-text highlight ">valuable to other
          fellows</span>. I enjoy showcasing my work while also learning from others.
          Curiosity then becomes a passion. The desire to bring digital things to
          life through code drives me to pay close <span className="about-text highlight ">attention to detail</span> and to
          <span className="about-text highlight ">value the design of products as much as programming.</span> I've been honing my
          skills ever since!

          I'm happiest when I'm creating, learning, exploring, and contemplating
          how to improve things. I'm currently completing <span className="about-text highlight ">GOMYCODE's Full-Stack
          JavaScript Bootcamp</span> and looking for a full-time position. Let's work
